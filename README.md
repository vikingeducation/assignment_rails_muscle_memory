This is a very simple Rails app to work muscle memory with Routes, Controllers and Views. This is the main goal - to display of a simple Article resource by performing all 7 of the RESTful actions:

Request the new article form ("new")
Submit the new article form ("create")
Read one article ("show")
See a listing of all articles ("index")
Request the edit article form ("edit")
Submit the edited article ("update")
Delete an article ("delete")
